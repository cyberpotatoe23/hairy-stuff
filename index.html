        <p>this is arie, the person who made the posters</p>
        <h1>sooo you are interested in my hair project ;)</h1>
        <h2>what is this about??</h2>
        <p>  
            i am interested in hair as a material because of 
            the complex relationship we have with it - how this weird 
            part of our body has become integral to our identities,
             how it can be both comforting and repulsive...
            <p>i will be researching hair as a material, and also use 
              it to make my own art
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>sooo i would need a lot of hair, much more than i can personally produce,
          this is why i am looking for hair donations. </p>
          <h2>what i'm looking for</h2>
          <p> can be
             of human origin or from other animals, <b>any amount</b> would be appreciated   </p>

        <h2>what would happen to the donation?</h2>
        <h3>your donation might:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>be taken pictures</li>
          <li>be scrutinized under a microscope</li>
          <li>be made into weird installations</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>it definitely will NOT be:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>planted on a crime scene</li>
          <li>used to clone you</li>
          <li>used for voodooism </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>also i will give you a little drawing as a thank-you note.  </h3>
